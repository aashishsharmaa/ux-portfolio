            <p>Payees are suppliers who sell goods & services to Amazon, and then send invoices to receive payments. These invoices, mostly in PDF format, were sent to Amazon via email. Amazon used to process these invoices through legacy systems.</p>

            <p>Amazon created Payee Central, using which payees could create invoices via webform.</p>
            <p>Webform involved manually filling in invoice details, requiring time, effort and cost, and thus was suitable for payees with low invoice volume.</p>
