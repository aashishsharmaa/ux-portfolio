          <article class="section-left"> 
            <p>I took over the designs made by the previous designer on the team. These were similar to the designs done by the Hotels team and used a cluster pin behavior.</p>
            <p>When a user would tap on a cluster pin, it would break down into multiple pins at a zoomed-in level. 
            </p>
            <p>The cluster pin was a component within the company-wide design system.

            <p>Data showed that nearly 35% of pins did not break further. It happened because a single supplier could supply multiple activities from a single location.

            <p>Hotels team did not face this issue as there is only one hotel at a location. It was not the case with activities.

            <p>Since this was close to launch, we agreed to use option (#3) a horizontal carousel for all pins, as it was available in the design system, and could be readily used by developers. Other options were not in the design system and needed more development time. 
            <p>Interestingly, post launch analytics showed that most users did not go past 3 cards.</p> 
            <p>And in a user study done by the UXR team, users requested to see a list view after first few cards. So option (#4) was what users needed.</p>
